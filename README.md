#  Credit Card Fraud Detection

# Objective:
This project aims to identify fraudulent transactions from a dataset of credit card transactions using machine learning. The goal is to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate with high accuracy.

# Dataset:
The project likely uses a dataset with features extracted from credit card transactions, including details that distinguish between normal and suspicious activities. Commonly used datasets include anonymized features to protect sensitive financial information.

# Methodology:

-Data Preprocessing: Techniques for handling imbalanced data, feature scaling, and cleaning were likely used to prepare the dataset.
-Model Selection: Various machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting, may be applied to classify transactions.
-Evaluation Metrics: Metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC are used to measure the model's performance, given the high importance of identifying fraud accurately without too many false positives.
# Results:
The project demonstrates effective detection of fraudulent transactions, balancing recall and precision to optimize fraud detection rates and minimize false positives. Insights from this model can assist financial institutions in preempting and preventing fraudulent activities.
